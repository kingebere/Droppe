[Live Demo](https://github.com/kingebere) :point_left:

## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/kingebere/
cd shopping-cart
npm install
npm start
```

## Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/)


## Bugs to fix
The fakestoreAPI isnt the greatest API in the world , hence ,I encountered challenges working with it and altered suitable choices I loved to make . Currently , The select field allows for duplicate selections of the name option which causes addition of duplicate fields values from the selected name  .Therefore, to get the intended result , please select a field only once until I come up with a suitable solution I hope to fix that bug . Seems challenging tho .
